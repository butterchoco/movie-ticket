### Running The Code
Navigate to one of the service (movie, ticket, purchase) then
run `./mvnw spring-boot:run`. You can also just simply run 
the Application class in Intellij IDEA. The service should be
active in these following ports:
- movie: 8080
- ticket: 8081
- purchase: 8082

Do notice that if you want to start all the services, you need
to open three terminal sessions and run each services independently.
